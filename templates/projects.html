          <p>
            Did a website for LOVE Synthesizers as my final project in Reykjavik University.
            I worked with Flask and AWS, and learned a lot about handling data, structuring larger codebases,
            and thinking more carefully about overall architecture.

          <h2 id="project_title">Neural Architecture Search Research</h2>
          <p>
            Worked over the summer of 2025 at Reykjavík University on research focused on optimizing CNN models for sleep stage classification.
            <br>The project was titled <strong>MELD: A Multimodal Ensemble of Lightweight 1D Convolutional Neural Networks for Sleep Stage Classification</strong>.
            <br>I worked on designing and implementing a genetic algorithm to identify effective kernel sizes for the models.
            <br>Turns out only tuning kernel sizes didn't do much, but that's a story for a different time.
          </p>

            The project resulted in a full technical report written for Rannís, detailing the methodology, experiments, and findings.

      <p>
        A metroidvania game developed during a 3-week intensive game design course at Reykjavík University.
        The core mechanic revolves around possessing enemies and fighting as them.
        I did a large portion of the programming and was responsible for tying systems together within the Unity engine.
        The project was built using C# and Unity, and served as a fast-paced introduction to working on a larger, collaborative codebase under tight deadlines.

          <h2 id="project_title">Grimoire</h2>
          <p>
            An roguelike deck-builder game started during my freshman year with my friendgroup.
            While the project never progressed beyond the prototyping phase, we implemented core gameplay ideas,
            conducted informal user testing, and iterated based on feedback.
            Building and testing a game from scratch in Godot using GDScript was a valuable learning experience in collaboration,
            scoping, and experimentation.

          Monkey Business was a project we built in a 3-week course in RU.
          It was a job application page that we made with Django.
          We used Python, SQL, HTMl, CSS, & Javascript.
